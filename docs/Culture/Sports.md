# Sports
Several sports beside the traditional human ones are described below.

## Brawling
Brawling is one-to-one fighting with no ill will intended, similar to boxing and the likes. It's especially populair among dragons. It involves two fighters being stacked up against one another, with or without weapons depending on the specific brawl's rules that have been agreed upon. The goal of a brawl is to take out the opponent by using various attacks.

### Spell
Especially when both contenders happen to be powerful creatures with devastating attacks, brawls may look bloody, but the two contenders will usually leave with only minor scruffs and scratches thanks to the brawling spell, which allows one to attack another without hurting them, instead only tiring them. The effects of the brawling spell will only work on others who are also enchanted by this spell, making it useless for actual combat.

### Types
Besides regular brawling, there are also other kinds of brawling. These tend to be more entertaining for a possible audience.

#### Power brawling
Power brawling is a variation on regular brawling in which the two brawlers each have a team mate called a "guider". A guider watches the fight and suggest when to use which attacks or when to look out for an incoming attack. In some cases, depending on a specific brawl's rules, a guider is allowed to use magical aids, usually three, that will allow the brawler to perform a special move like a strong attack or some kind of defensive shield. In case the guider cannot perform these spells, may it be because they can't use magic or is too unexperienced, they usually use ability cards instead. They contain both the spell and the magic needed to perform one certain magical aid once. After the match, they have to be re-enchanted to be used again.

#### Techno brawling
The same as regular brawling, but instead of the participants themselves brawling their robots or devices do instead. Each participant has and controls their own during the brawl. The first robot that cannot continue to brawl, usually because of some component breaking, loses.
