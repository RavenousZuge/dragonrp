## Fairies
Fairies are creatures with immense magical potential. They can generally only exert magic onto everything but themselves, so they usually attack by manipulating their environment. This usually involves growing plantlike structures and moving boulders. When paired together with an ally (who does not happen to be a fairy), they often choose to help them instead, usually done so by healing, but also by temporarily enhancing their abilities. They can also transform others into other creatures for a short time. One peculiarity about fairy magic is that it can be resisted by the one who it's casted upon. Shapeshifting spells can only be resisted during the transformation.

## Subspecies
Aside from the regular fairies as described above, there are also other fairy-kind like the ones described below.

## Sprixies
Sprixies, unlike great fairies, omit light and are tiny in size, often barely reaching over 10 centimetres. Their magical potential pales in comparison to great fairies and lack certain abilities like shapeshifting others into different creatures.

## Dark fairies
Dark fairies, also called demonic fairies, are the direct opposite of regular fairies, using their fairy magic against their foes instead of using it to help their allies. Instead of using healing and power-enhancing spells, they usually use their magic to weaken others. However, they do also manipulate environments to work in their favour. Another similarity can be found in the fact that a dark fairies' magic can also be resisted, but by doing the complete opposite. Instead of resisting it by resisting it, you can resist it by allowing it to infest your body, after which it will quickly leave. One side-effect this has is that it's nearly impossible for them to shape-shift others into different creatures, as after the transformation the spell cannot be resisted anymore (as one can hardly resist their own body), thus actually undoing the transformation.
