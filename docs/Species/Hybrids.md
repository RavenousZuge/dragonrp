# Hybrids
Hybrids are humans who have inherited genes and phenotypes from another species by means of [[innerworkings:technology#gene_therapy|gene therapy]]. They are most often described as human-like beings with animalistic features.
## Procedure
The procedure of turning a human into a hybrid using [[innerworkings:technology#gene_therapy|gene therapy]] is called "hybridisation". In general, the procedure goes as follows:
  - At first, the desired DNA will be extracted from the desired species or creature, after which it will be prepped for transfusion.
  - In combination with mutagen, it is injected into the body. The patient might experience fever and other symptoms as their immune system gets attacked.
  - It usually takes quite a while for the changes to be implemented. Small modifications usually require a day. Incubation usually speeds up the process by about three times. When a patient is incubated, they are unconscious. A patient not being incubated might remain conscious during the hybridisation, which usually is not quite pleasant as they are likely to experience severe pain.

### Risks
Hybridisation is not without it's risks. Possible side-effects include:
  * The patient might inherit characteristics from the DNA they did not want to have.
  * Unwanted mutations may occur during the treatment, causing deformities or illnesses.
  * If the modifications are done too quickly, the patient's body might get overencumbered.
  * Large modifications might change brain structure, which may cause shifts in personality.

## Forced hybridisation
Certain illnesses that would be deadly to a human require gene therapy to heal and recover from it. This means that they will inherit DNA from a creature that is resistant to that particular illness. Due to the nature of gene therapy, it will also mean that they will likely inherit other features of that particular creature's species and, essentially, turn into a hybrid. As the affected person usually has no other choice than death, we call this forced hybridisation.
