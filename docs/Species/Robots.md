# Robots
Man-made machines that leverage [[innerworkings:technology#artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] to mimic an intelligent, sentient being's behaviour and thinking. Robots bearing a close resamblance to humans may also be called Androids.

# Appearance
Most robots tend to resemble a human, but this is not always the case. Appearance between robots can very wildly, as they are very customisable and come in many different shapes and forms.

# Abilities
Being a robot comes with several perks:

  * Highly upgradable and customisable
  * Almost all parts can be repaired or replaced
  * Can be equipped to perform a certain task more efficiently

# Limitations
In recent years, [[innerworkings:technology#artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] has reached a point at which robots are able to have free will. This means that a robot can assess situations for themselves and act accordingly without needing any external input. Often, certain restrictions do still apply because of safety measures in their programming, most notably:

  * A robot must obey their master's commands.
  * A robot can be turned off by the owner at any time.
  * A robot's memory could be altered or wiped by the owner.

Furthermore, a robot also exerts the following limitations:

  * Often only limited resistance to water and other fluids.
  * Not self-healing and must be repaired when broken or damaged.
  * Like any other electronic device, it can be hacked or exploited.
  * Cannot use magic, as it's no live Farian being.

# Common misconceptions
  * A robot still has to learn new things through repetition, despite being a robot. If not, the things they're trying to learn may only end up in RAM, which is short-term memory only. It does this to prevent unnecessary data from being saved to the long-term storage, of which there is only a limited amount.
  * Many robots are capable of creative thinking.
  * Robots have morals, just like live creatures do. This means that most robots by themselves won't suddenly turn "evil" and go on murderous rampages as some might suggest.
  * In most cases, it's best not to address a robot-being using "it" as it may upset them and/or make them feel inferior.
