# Arthronians
Creatures that are often Arthropod-like in appearance. They usually inherit their abilities and appearance from the arthropod they are based on, their so-called "base". Just how arthropods are incredibly diverse, so are the arthronians. One trait each Arthronian has in common, though, is that each has an exoskeleton and a segmented body.
## Abilities
Most arthronians have a hard outer shell that's hard to pierce for enemies, but other than that, abilities vary wildly among. This is because each has a different base, the arthropod they are based on. For example, a wasp-like would be able to sting someone, a spider-like would be able to produce silk, a lobster-like would have huge claws, et cetera.
## Appearance
Appearance, just like the abilities one may posses, can varies among each individual. They do, however, almost always have four or more limbs. They are usually slightly taller than humans, but if the base arthropod is of a smaller kind they might end up growing shorter.

## Subspecies
For every single species of arthropod there is a subspecies of arthronian, which would be impossible to list all on one page. These can, however, be divided into three types: insect-like, arachnid-like and crustacean-like.

### Insect-like
