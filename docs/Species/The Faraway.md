# The Faraway
What the humans refer to as the creatures from the Other Realm, the world where these magical creatures came from. If there is one thing that each of the Faraway would have in common, it's their relationship with magic. Because their very DNA is intertwined with magic, it has become second nature to them, relying on it for survival. Just like technology is bound by the laws of physics, [[innerworkings:magic#rules|magic is bound by its own rules]].
