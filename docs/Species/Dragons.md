# Dragons
Huge, ancient and immensely powerful reptile-like creatures capable of causing a lot of damage, but are generally very peaceful and, luckily, rarely use their destructive abilities. Their diet usually consists of meat, but can also be seen eating other food when eating meat is not an option. Most dragons are scaled, but they may also have feathers or fur.

They are  intelligent, yet also stubborn. They are also not quick to trust someone, but when they do, they usually become very attached.

## Subspecies
Over the years, dragons have split into several subspecies. These are listed below.

### Western Dragon
This dragon has four limbs and one set of wings. Most are able to fly. They are called western dragons because they most resemble the dragons in western culture. Their brute force makes them one of the most destructive subspecies. Some but not all western dragons are able to breathe fire.

### Eastern Dragon
These kind of dragons differ wildly from western dragons, sometimes they are even called their opposite. Their build is slim and they do not have wings, but a few are born with some form of inherited magic that enables them to fly regardless. They have four or more limbs. Their tails are also often exceptionally long. Their thin body allows them them to more easily dodge attacks. They often live in Asian countries where they are worshipped as they resemble the dragons of most Asian folk lore. This is also the reason why they are called eastern dragons. A small groep of eastern dragons are born with the ability to control water.

### Wyvern
A dragon with two hind legs and two wings. Some wyverns walk using just these two hind legs, but others also use their wings to help support their body. They also frequently have a barbed tail. Wyverns are fine-tuned for flight, being generally more agile when taking to the skies than other species.

### Aquatic Dragon
Aquatic dragons are dragons that live underater. They have long tails that, like their limbs and other parts of their bodys, are finned to help them propel forward underwater. Their body is, in general, more flexible than other dragons. They also lack horns, spikes and wings as the extra weight would slow them down underwater. Despite their bodies being fine-tuned for swimming, they can also walk and even live on land. However, because of all their fins on the limbs and in-between the digits they are significantly slower than other species. Their lack of horns and spikes might also leave them more vulnerable.
