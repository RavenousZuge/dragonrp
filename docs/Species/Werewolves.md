# Werewolves
Humanoids with the ability to shape-shift into a wolf-like creature. It's said that a rare disease from long ago occurring only in wild beasts made its way to other creatures in the form of lycanthropy. Others, mainly werewolves, argue it's a gift that has been bestowed upon them.

## Abilities
Werewolves usually enjoy a heightened sense of smell, improved hearing, increased strength, speed and more. Size, weight and other aspects of the werewolf are relative to the creature's species. They become slightly taller and grow fur on various places of their body. Their face also becomes more wolf-like.

## Breeding
Lycantrophty does not get transfered to the child, no matter if either one or both parents have it, because a fetus' blood never comes into contact with the mother's. It's up to the parents to decide whether they want their young to be a werewolf. If this is the case, they will usually transfer the disease right after birth as then the transformation will be less intense.

## Transformation
Some werewolves can transfer the disease by biting someone, but most cannot. Instead, they can transfer the disease by blood to blood contact. After infliction, lycanthropy slowly but surely makes itself known. It does so in several stages. At first, the victim will notice increased smell, hearing and hair growth, after which subtle personality changes follow. They will feel the urge to howl, hunt and seek a pack. These symptoms get worse over time and will follow up until the third night, after which the victim will transform into a full werewolf. They will remain a werewolf until the sun dawns, after which they gain the ability to transform back and fourth between their normal and beastly form.
