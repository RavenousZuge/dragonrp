# Humans
Humans are four-limbed bipeds that are by far the most common creatures on earth. They are native to planet earth. Whilst they are comparatively weak on their own, their ability to create powerful tools and cooperate with others allowed them to become one of the most successful species on earth.

## Appearance
### Height
The male adult humans are usually taller than the females. This is also true for the other stages of a human's life, except early puberty, where girls average out.

### Tones and colours
Most notably, their skin tone, hair colour and eye colour can vary. A human's skin tone can be white, black or anything in-between. Generally speaking, the same also applies to hair colours (with the exception of red and dyed hair), but black, brown, blonde and grey are by far the most common. An eye colours in humans are quite varied, usually being amber, blue, brown, grey, green or hazel. In some cases, like certain medical conditions or contact lenses, eye colour may deviate from the usual.

## Abilities

### Co-operation
Humans are unprecedented at social communication and creating large advanced societies which allows them to specialise. By combining each individual's skill, humanity is able to be a force to be dealt with despite their lack of physical strength or magic which with each passing day becomes less of a weakness thanks to one of their biggest inventions: technology.

### Technological Proficiency
Humanity's use of technology is amongst any kind of creature the largest. Though the devices that are used nowadays are too complex to be created or manufactured by one human themselves, it is exceptionally rare for a human not to make use of one.

### Magic Resistance
Most humans offer some natural resistance to magic, making them less vulnerable to those kind of attacks but also making it nearly impossible for them use it themselves. There are, however, humans whose magical resistance has been purged, making magic just as easy to learn as it is for most other Faraway creatures. It is, despite their magical resistance, still possible to be cursed or attract diseases from the other realm, including vampirism and lycanthropy.
