# Characters

## Applications
In order to use your character in a thread, you must submit a character information sheet. We recommend you to include the following information:

* Name
* Gender
* Species
* Appearance
* Personality
* Skills and abilities
* Backstory

Of course, you may include whatever else you want, like images or extra tidbits about your character.

### Balancing
Technically, any character can be made as powerful as you want them to be as long as they abide  However, all characters with magical abilities are subjected to our [magic system](/wiki/innerworkings/magic/). They must also abide the strentgh/weakness rule. This means that all characters' strengths must be balanced a weakness or consequence if their powers are too extravagant.

!!! example
    If your character is able to kill someone very powerful, there must be consequences for him or her to do that action, something that would make it impossible or undesirable so that it would be a last resort only. If your character is incredibly powerful with fire magic, it makes sense to counter this strength with a weakness to to the cold.

In short, if you make powerful characters, make sure you balance them accordingly.

### Sumbitting
Your character sheet must be contained in a markdown file.Once you have created your character information sheet, you must upload this file and submit it for approval to an administrator. We will let you know as soon as possible whether your character is approved or whether something is still missing. Once your character is approved, you can immedietly start using it in role-play!

!!! help
    If you don't know how to create a markdown file, consider using an online editor like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) and export it as a markdown file from there.
