## What is this?
Dragon RP is a role-playing forum with a unique blend of fantasy and science fiction. Players start by creating their own characters, after which they can join a thread in which they will use them to play out stories that happen in the Dragon RP universe. Your characters can influence other player's ones and, ultimately, also the world's fate, so be careful!

This wiki contains most information about the our world that might be needed in your role-play. Please note that there may be exceptions to things stated on the wiki, especially in regards to species.

## Getting started
We can't wait to welcome you to our community! To join, you are required to create a [Discord account](https://discordapp.com/register) and join the Dragon RP [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MJ2HGkT). This will only be required during the alpha period.

!!! info
    After Dragon RP leaves alpha, you are no longer required to use Discord.
    
We will help you get started once you join the Discord server. Don't be ashamed to ask for help!

In the meantime, browse through this wiki to learn more about the world you will be role-playing in. Also take a look at the list of species, as you will have to choose a species for your character you're going to role-play as.
