# Power structure
Refers to the overall level of power a character on Pactbound may have. We do not keep strict track on how powerful a character is. This page only serves to give an idea on which areas your character is relatively powerful or weak and can come in handy as a reference for coming up with a balanced character.

## Starting point =====
Each character starts out with a relatively average amount of power. They should have for each strength a weakness to compensate. Of course, you may also create a relatively weak character, which may actually be more enjoyable to write about, as a character overcoming their weaknesses instead of one that is already strong might be more satisfying to write about. What you may not do, is create one that is overpowered. Strength can only be acquired by your character overcoming their weaknesses in whichever thread they take part in.
