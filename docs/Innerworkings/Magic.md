# Magic
Magic, of which its inner workings perplex scientists to this very day, is an incredibly powerful force that can either be used for good or evil. Whether it's better or worse than human technology is debatable, but it's usually preferred by the Faraway.

## System
On Dragon RP, we use a unique magic system which combines both hard and soft elements.

  * Hard magic systems have clearly defined rules and limitations
  * Soft magic systems have vaguely defined rules and allow for a lot of creativity

Both of these systems have their advantages and disadvantages. We cherry pick the best elements of both systems to provide you the most enjoyable experience.

## Types 
Magic can be split into three types:

  * Elemental magic
  * General magic
  * Inherited magic

Elemental magic is incredibly powerful, but limited to just one element and in most cases harder to learn than general magic. General magic refers to magic that doesn't really belong under any one element, like moving objects or building structures. Inherited magic refers to magical capabilities one is born with. Which magic one inherits depends on their species (as described in their wiki entries) or bloodline. This magic can either be elemental or general.

## Rules
Magic has its limits as defined by the rules described below.

  * Magic always depletes some form of energy

Magic cannot be used endlessly; it must be used sparingly as it depletes energy. In general, using magic either depletes your stamina or life energy. As you learn magic, you get to know how to make your spells more energy-efficient, thus making you more powerful.

Using your stamina makes you tired, but it can easily be restored by resting, whereas life energy, sometimes also called soul energy, cannot. Life energy is an incredibly powerful kind of energy directly connected to your soul and ability to live. Using it shortens your lifespan or may even kill you. After using it, the practitioner may temporarily become unconscious. Whether they do depends on their skill. In general, you never want to deplete this kind of energy unless it's absolutely necessary.

  * Magic cannot create anything ever-lasting out of nothing

Let's say you would like to build a statue using magic. The statue continues to exist after the spell has been casted. We can say that the statue is ever-lasting. Fire, on the other hand, is not ever-lasting. After fire has been casted, in may set things ablaze, but the fire you created eventually stops existing. We can say that fire is not ever-lasting.

As stated by this rule, magic cannot create anything ever-lasting out of nothing. So for a statue you cannot use just magic alone, you would need, for example, a huge boulder to start with. A fire-based attack, however, can be created with just magic alone, so is the same with any attack involving wind. However, the water you use for a water-based spell, for example, continues to exist after you cast it, thus you must source it from somewhere first. Similarly, if you were to turn rock into lava, you would first have to find some.

  * Magic can change something's properties, but not forever

Magic can change properties of certain things. For example, you could make iron appear like gold. However, these changes are always only temporarorary, meaning that the spell will eventually wear off and the item will revert back to its original properties. The length of time before this occurs depends on how powerful the magic used was on one object. The power needed to change a material's properties depends on the amount and how big the changes are.

This rule only applies to materials. Magic could, for example, alter live creatures permanantly, though it usually requires magical capabilities beyond any one wielder.
