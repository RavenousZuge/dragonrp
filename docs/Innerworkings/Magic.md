# Magic
Magic, of which its inner workings perplex scientists to this very day, is an incredibly powerful force that can either be used for good or evil. Whether it's better or worse than human technology is debatable, but it's usually preferred by the Faraway.

## System
On Pactbound, we use a unique magic system which combines both hard and soft elements.

  * Hard magic systems have clearly defined rules and limitations
  * Soft magic systems have vaguely defined rules and allow for a lot of creativity

Both of these systems have their advantages and disadvantages. On Pactbound, we cherry pick the best elements of both systems to provide you the most enjoyable experience.

## Types 
Magic can be split into three types:

  * Elemental magic
  * General magic (also called common magic)
  * Inherited magic

Elemental magic is incredibly powerful, but limited to just one element and harder to learn than general magic. General magic can work regardless of a certain element and is also a more broader reaching than elemental magic. Inherited magic refers to magical capabilities one is born with, like the magic fairies posses. Which magic one inherits depends on their species (as described in their wiki entries) or bloodline.

## Rules
Magic has its limits as defined by the so-called "unspoken rules" as seen below.

  * Magic always depletes some form of energy

Magic cannot be used endlessly and must be used sparingly as it depletes energy. In general, using magic either depletes your stamina or life energy. As you learn magic, you get to know how to make your spells more energy-efficient. Elemental magic is more efficient than general magic, which is why it's more powerful, but it's restricted to one element, making it in some situations completely useless.

Using your stamina makes you tired, but it can easily be restored by resting, whereas life energy, sometimes also called soul energy, cannot. Life energy is an incredibly powerful kind of energy directly connected to your soul and ability to live. Using it shortens your lifespan or may even kill you. After using it, the practitioner may temporarily become unconscious. Whether they do depends on their skill. In general, you never want to deplete this kind of energy unless it's absolutely necessary.

  * Magic cannot create anything ever-lasting out of nothing

First off, it's best to describe what is and isn't "ever-lasting". Let's say you would like to build a statue using magic. The statue continues to exist after the spell has been completed. We can say that the statue is ever-lasting. A fire attack, on the other hand, is not ever-lasting. After the attack has been carried out and the spell has been used, the fire you created eventually stops existing. We can say that fire is not ever-lasting.

As stated by this rule, magic cannot create anything ever-lasting out of nothing. So for a statue you cannot use just magic alone, you would need, for example, a huge boulder to start with. A fire-based attack, however, can be created with just magic alone. This is not to say that every elemental attack isn't ever-lasting. The water you use for a water-based attack, for example, continues to exist after your attack, thus you must source it from somewhere first.

  * Magic can change something's properties, but not it itself

This rule can also be best explained with an example. Take, for instance, an iron ingot. You can use magic to give it the same properties as gold, from colour to the metal's softness, but it will inherently still be the very same iron ingot. It can always be reverted to its original state, even though one may not know which properties something originally had. Materials that have been treated this way cannot be used in most alchemy, which is why there's still a demand for genuine materials that have not been treated to have its properties changed. In practise, however, an iron ingot treated to have the same properties as gold will look and behave exactly the same.
