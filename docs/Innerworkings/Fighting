# Fighting
Sometimes, characters can get into conflict, or you need to escape a nasty situation. Sometimes, the only solution is to fight. It's important to take the things on this page into consideration.

## Skills and abilities
The kind of attacks your character is able to carry out must be defined in your character page. You may define them under skills, abilities and/or some other section.

## Killing
There are strict rules concerning killing player characters.

* Others may not kill a player's character without their explicit permission.
* Character entry / entries must be updated to reflect this if necessairy.
* The player of the character that has died in question must contact an administrator to get their character marked deceased.

The latter two rules also apply when a character dies through others means than being killed by another player character, like an NPC or some natural cause.

!!! warning
    A character's death is usually irreversible. Only allow your character to be killed if you are completely certain!

## Guns
Any firearms may not be used by any player character unless the particular quest requires you to do so. Fantasy guns that use magical means to fire or simmalar are except from this rule.

!!! info
    On the Overworld, firearms are heavily regulated world-wide. They are incredibly hard to come by and governmental agencies have switched to alternative non-lethal weapons as they have become just as effective as deadly weapons in terms of disabling targets. In the Underworld, firearms being a human invention, they are seen as diabolical and are scoffed at. As such, they make no appearance here.
