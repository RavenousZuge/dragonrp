# Fighting
Sometimes, characters can get into conflict, or you need to escape a nasty situation. Sometimes, the only solution is to fight. It's important to take the things on this page into consideration.

## Killing
There are also strict rules concerning killing characters played by others.

* Others may not kill a player's character without their explicit permission.
* Character entry / entires must be updated to reflect this if necessairy.
* The player of the character that has died in question must contact an administrator to get their character marked deceased.

!!! warning
    A character's death is usually irreversible. Only allow your character to be killed if you are completely certain!

## Guns
Any firearms may not be used by any player character unless the particular quest requires you to do so. Fantasy guns that use magical means to fire or simmalar are except from this rule.

!!! info
    On the Overworld, firearms are heavily regulated world-wide. They are incredibly hard to come by and governmental agencies have switched to alternative non-lethal weapons as they have become just as effective as deadly weapons in terms of disabling targets. In the Underworld, firearms being a human invention, they are seen as diabolical and are scoffed at. As such, they make no appearance.
    
Quests, with approval from an administrator, may allow a player of NPC to wield a firearm under specific circumstances.
