# Language
After the Faraway creatures arrived on earth, society was faced with a problem. The amount of different languages spoken quadrupled and language barriers were becoming a serious problem. A solution needed to be found quickly. It was agreed upon to adopt one common language around the globe. Nowadays, almost everyone, may it be a human or a Faraway creature, is able to speak it.

## Common
A common language under the creatures of the underworld. Like English, many creatures have it as either their first of secondary language.

## Traditional
Traditional languages, the languages spoken before English was globalised, do still exist but are slowly falling into obscurity. Both the Faraway and humans have them. Regardless, they can still come in handy for things like becoming part of certain communities or deciphering old texts.

## Inherited
Some species may be born with the ability to speak a certain language. These are called "inherited languages". The new-born will not have to put in any effort into learning such languages and will either immedietly or slowly come to master it in the first years of their lives.
